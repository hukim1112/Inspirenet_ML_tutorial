# Machine Learning tutorial

We, InspireNet members, decided to spend our time to learn Machine Learning for getting explicit and basic concepts on it. Every week we come together, discuss the lectures(especially Ng's) we assigned and rearrange that as some documents. For that, recommend to use some common tools like below.

-  Typora for writing documents
-  git and github.com for sharing documents and codes
-  python as programming language and TensorFlow as ML framework

I want you to put effort into documents you will make, because It could help other people to need well-made documents for ML tutorial. Lastly If you have difficulties on lecture before coming to meeting, visit [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/discussions?sort=lastActivityAtDesc&page=1)
